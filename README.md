# Docker Setup

This application utilizes Docker Compose to run the services in containers. The services include:

- **FastAPI** - The main FastAPI application that serves the API endpoints. 
- **Celery Worker** - The Celery worker that executes async tasks queued from FastAPI.
- **RabbitMQ** - The message broker used to send tasks between FastAPI and Celery.
- **Flower** - A web UI for monitoring and administrating Celery clusters and workers.

## Running the services

To start all the services, run:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

This will start the FastAPI service on port 8080, Celery worker, RabbitMQ on the default ports, and Flower on port 5555.

## Accessing the services

- FastAPI - http://localhost:8080/wait
- RabbitMQ - http://localhost:15672 (User: guest, Pass: guest)
- Flower - http://localhost:5555

RabbitMQ and Flower provide admin UI's to monitor queues, workers, tasks, etc.

The FastAPI service runs the main application and API endpoints.
